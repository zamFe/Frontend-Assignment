    "body": "<p>Fram means &lsquo;forward&rsquo; &ndash; lifting expectations of the voyage at hand. MS Fram was built in 2007 with one mission in mind &ndash; to bring her guests closer to nature, wildlife and unforgettable experiences. The spacious outside decks include access to the very front of the ship &ndash; a great place to observe marine wildlife.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MS Fram was refurbished in 2020 and now holds upgraded cabins, suites and public areas with relaxed, comfortable and stylish setting &ndash; including new restaurants and Hurtigruten&rsquo;s signature, Science Center.</p>\n<h2>Built for polar expeditions</h2>\n<p>The ship is purpose built as an expedition vessel with a higher ice-class, chart drawing tools, ship depth sounding database, extractable forward sounding sonar, iceberg search lights, autonomous tracking system, oversized oil retention system for self-sufficiency, and a full &lsquo;expedition tools-deck&rsquo; equivalent to a car-deck that holds 25 vehicles. We believe that as an explorer you need an &lsquo;expedition base-camp&rsquo; that is comfortable &ndash; something that combines &lsquo;all oceans capabilities&rsquo; with safety, flexibility and environmental friendliness. That&rsquo;s Fram &ndash; simply the best expedition ship imaginable.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Built for polar expeditions</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Facilities on board</h2>\n<p>The Explorer Lounge &amp; Bar, with comfortable sitting areas at the top of the ship and large panoramic windows, gives you incredible views of nature. A pair of binoculars is installed for spotting wildlife and details of the ever changing landscape.</p>\n<p>In the restaurant on deck 5, you can enjoy the finest cuisine. The floor has different levels, so no matter where your table is placed; there are views to the outdoors. The restaurants are located in the aft of the ship. On deck 7 you will find a well-equipped gym, with its panoramic ocean view there is no better place to exercise. On top of the ship you can get warm and cosy in the sauna or bathe in one of the outdoor hot tubs. Let the warm water surround you while the icebergs float silently past the side of the ship.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Facilities on board</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cabins and art</h2>\n<p>With 125 cabins on Fram, you have a choice of comfortable cabins and a number of superior suites to choose from. Our suites are named after Norwegian polar heroes, MS Fram travels in the wake of these great explorers. We are very proud of the art commissioned for MS Fram &ndash; local artists from the Arctic have contributed to making her a modern masterpiece. The &lsquo;tender pit&rsquo; is where we embark, fully dressed in suitable expedition and excursion gear, on our sturdy Polarcirkel boats to take you safely from ship to shore. The original Fram was a ship for broadening the understanding of the world &ndash; let the new MS Fram do the same for you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/link/2e37b8f3460641b98e917f633950b194.aspx\">Practical information for Expedition cruises with MS Fram</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ship facilites</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Expedition Team</li>\n<li>Science Centre</li>\n<li>Explorer lounge &amp; bar</li>\n<li>Wi-Fi</li>\n<li>2 restaurants</li>\n<li>Shop</li>\n<li>Sauna</li>\n<li>Hot tubs</li>\n<li>Gym</li>\n<li>Outdoor gym</li>\n<li>Lift</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Contact&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Tel: <span class=\"baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">+47 85 00 11 00<a style=\"margin: 0px; border: currentColor; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 16px; height: 16px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: middle; float: none; display: inline; white-space: nowrap; position: static !important;\" title=\"Call: +47 85 00 11 00\" href=\"#\"><img style=\"margin: 0px; border: currentColor; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 16px; height: 16px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; overflow: hidden; vertical-align: middle; float: none; display: inline; white-space: nowrap; position: static !important;\" title=\"Call: +47 85 00 11 00\" src=\"/link/b0b4b643def9483483ca6c996ae3c86a.aspx\" alt=\"blobid0.png\" /></a></span>&nbsp;<br />Email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:reception@fr.hurtigruten.com\">reception@fr.hurtigruten.com</a></p>",

The ship&acute;s spacious, two-storey panorama lounge is above the bow. Its wall-to-wall windows bathe the lounge in natural light and provide extraordinary views.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Expedition Team on board</h2>\n<p>MS Trollfjord has her own on-board Expedition Team and serve as a university at sea. Interesting lectures, presentations and activities inside the ship as well as out on the sun deck make this an exciting and educational journey. Topics depend on the season and the waters we sail in. The Expedition Team will host a lecture and presentation programme and evening gatherings daily.</p>\n<p>Out on deck you can participate in live points of interest to learn more about the nature, culture and other phenomena we encounter along the coast. In addition, the Expedition Team will introduce you to the uniquely Norwegian notion of `friluftsliv&acute; (outdoor life), and encourage you take part in `friluftsliv&acute; hikes and activities during the journey. Our dedicated Expedition Teams have one mission: to enhance your experience by engaging you and interpreting the nature, wildlife, and culture you encounter during the voyage.

Hurtigruten is constantly pushing boundaries, and aim to become completely emission free. As the first cruise line in the world, Hurtigruten is permanently introducing biodiesel as fuel on a number of ships &ndash; including MS Trollfjord.</p>\n<p>Biodiesel reduces (CO2) emissions with up to 80 % (compared to regular marine diesel). Hurtigruten&rsquo;s environmentally certified biodiesel is produced from waste from industries such as fisheries and agriculture &ndash; which means no palm oil is used in the biofuel production and no negative effects on rainforests. Hurtigruten will use biodiesel in combination with other low-emission fuel.</p>\n<p>As the rest of the Hurtigruten fleet, single-use plastic is banned on MS Trollfjord. This ship is also equipped for shore power, completely eliminating emissions when docked in ports with shore power facilities.</p>\n<h3>Useful links:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/link/fe97acb7970a4e72a459f13ea5f8e03b.aspx\">Practical and onboard information for cruises along the Norwegian Coast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/link/0f70a35d6ccb4bd0a42d1706d02d63f3.aspx\">Practical and onboard infromation about expedition cruises on MS Trollfjord</a>&nbsp;(from 2021)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ship facilities:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Expedition Team</li>\n<li>Two-storey panorama lounge (Explorer Lounge &amp; Bar from 2021)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Bars</li>\n<li>Caf&eacute;</li>\n<li>Library</li>\n<li>Wi-Fi</li>\n<li>Restaurant</li>\n<li>Separate &aacute; la carte dining room</li>\n<li>Sauna</li>\n<li>Hot tub</li>\n<li>Fitness room</li>\n<li>Shop</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Parking spaces on board</h3>\n<p>The following dimensions for vehicles onboard coastal voyages.

On board are three different restaurants, the Multe bakery and ice cream bar, a sauna and fitness room. Out on deck you can enjoy the view from one of our two hot tubs. We have a comfortable bar at the front of the ship where you can enjoy a nice traditional drink. The vessel also has a large compass area where you find the reception, a tour guide, conference room and shop.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Inside the ship</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Expedition team on board</h2>\n<p>MS Nordnorge has her own on-board Expedition Team and serves as a university at sea. Interesting lectures, presentations and activities inside as well as out on the sun deck of the ship make this an exciting and educational journey. Topics depend on the season and the waters we sail in. The Expedition Team will host a lecture and presentation programme and evening gatherings daily. Out on deck you may participate in live points of interest to learn more about the nature, culture and other phenomena we encounter along the coast. In addition, the Expedition Team will introduce you to the uniquely Norwegian notion of `friluftsliv&acute;, and encourage you take part in `friluftsliv&acute; hikes and activities during the journey.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Outside the ship</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The dedicated Expedition Team has one mission: to enhance your experience by engaging you and interpreting the nature, wildlife, and culture you encounter during the voyage.

    "body": "<p>MS Nordkapp was refurbished in 2016 and now features a modern, Arctic-inspired interior. On board are three different restaurants, a Multe bakery and ice cream bar, a sauna and fitness room. Out on deck you can enjoy the view from one of our two hot tubs. We also have a cosy bar at the front of the ship where you can enjoy a nice traditional drink. The ship additionally has a large compass area with reception, a tour guide, conference room and shop.&nbsp;<br /><br />MS Nordkapp was christened by Norway&acute;s Queen Sonja in 1996 and her maiden voyage was to the Shetland Islands. The ship started sailing the <a href=\"/link/1c89119a84a64fef91b93f9f042f7600.aspx\">Norwegian coast</a> in April 1996. She has also sailed in <a href=\"/link/d3e4536ea0784713b5a46dfbf08bef32.aspx\">Antarctica</a>. Since 2007, the vessel has been part of Hurtigruten&acute;s fleet of ships dedicated to sailing the Norwegian coastline.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Interiour</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>On-board Expedition team</h2>\n<p>MS Nordkapp has her own on-board Expedition Team and serves as a university at sea. Interesting lectures, presentations and activities inside as well as out on the sun deck of the ship make this an exciting and educational journey. Topics depend on the season and the waters we sail in. The Expedition Team hosts a lecture and presentation programme and evening gatherings daily. Out on deck you may participate in live points of interest to learn more about the nature, culture and other phenomena we encounter along the coast. In addition, the Expedition Team will introduce you to the uniquely Norwegian notion of `friluftsliv&acute;, and encourage you take part in `friluftsliv&acute; hikes and activities during the journey.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The dedicated Expedition Team has one mission: to enhance your experience by engaging you and interpreting the nature, wildlife, and culture you encounter during the voyage.

On board are three different restaurants, the Multe bakery and ice cream bar, a sauna and fitness room. Out on deck you can enjoy the view from one of our two hot tubs. We have a comfortable bar at the front of the ship where you can enjoy a nice traditional drink. The vessel also has a large compass area where you find the reception, the expedition team, conference room and shop.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">The ship</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Expedition team on board</h2>\n<p>MS Polarlys has her own on-board Expedition Team and serves as a university at sea. Interesting lectures, presentations and activities inside as well as out on the sun deck of the ship make this an exciting and educational journey. Topics depend on the season and the waters we sail in. The Expedition Team will host a lecture and presentation programme and evening gatherings daily. Out on deck you may participate in live points of interest to learn more about the nature, culture and other phenomena we encounter along the coast. In addition, the Expedition Team will introduce you to the uniquely Norwegian notion of `friluftsliv&acute;, and encourage you take part in `friluftsliv&acute; hikes and activities during the journey.</p>\n<p>The dedicated Expedition Team has one mission: to enhance your experience by engaging you and interpreting the nature, wildlife, and culture you encounter during the voyage.

On deck 6, a number of cabins were merged into <strong>larger suites</strong>, some with large bay windows and spectacular views.</li>\n<li>In addition to a full makeover, the aft-facing <strong>Torget main restaurant</strong> has large deck-to-ceiling windows.</li>\n<li>The brand-new <strong>Activity Center&nbsp;</strong>will act as the on-board headquarter for Hurtigruten&rsquo;s Expedition Team.</li>\n<li><strong>Kysten Fine Dining</strong> - serving innovative dishes based on high quality, local produce such as ultra-fresh seafood - is slightly different from other Hurtigruten ships, and also be open for a la carte lunch.</li>\n<li>The <strong>gym</strong> on deck 7 is bigger, the <strong>sauna</strong> upgraded and two aft-facing outdoor<strong> hot tubs</strong> are added.</li>\n<li>Two new <strong>lecture halls</strong> have been added on deck 4, together with the open <strong>Kompass information and shopping area</strong>, where guests can enjoy exclusive offers on outdoor clothing and other items.</li>\n<li>On deck 7, the informal and hugely popular Hurtigruten venue <strong>Multe Bakery</strong>&nbsp;is now open- serving freshly baked cakes and pastries,&nbsp;<em style=\"font-size: 1.1875rem;\">sm&oslash;rbr&oslash;d</em><span style=\"font-size: 1.1875rem;\">&nbsp;(open sandwiches with generous amounts of topping), smoothies, a large assortment of local ice cream with homemade toppings, premium coffee, organic herbal tea, and premium juice.</span></li>\n<li>The forward-facing <strong>Explorer Lounge and Panorama Bar</strong> offers a unique atmosphere and the best views on the ship &ndash; with front-row seats for enjoying the Northern Lights, Midnight Sun, wildlife and nature as it passes by.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Expedition team on board</h2>\n<p>MS Nordlys has her own on-board Expedition Team that serves as a university at sea. Interesting lectures, presentations and activities inside as well as out on the sun deck of the ship make this an exciting and educational journey. Topics depend on the season and the waters we sail in. The Expedition Team will host a lecture and presentation programme and evening gatherings daily. Out on deck you may participate in live points of interest to learn more about the nature, culture and other phenomena we encounter along the coast. In addition, the Expedition Team will introduce you to the uniquely Norwegian notion of `friluftsliv&acute;, and encourage you take part in `friluftsliv&acute; hikes and activities during the journey.</p>\n<p>The dedicated Expedition Team has one mission: to enhance your experience by engaging you and interpreting the nature, wildlife, and culture you encounter during the voyage.

The MS Richard With lives up to that legacy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Relax in the ship's panorama lounges and take in the unforgettable views of remarkable coastal scenery, much of it the same as when the first Hurtigruten boats sailed by more than a century ago. Beautiful art throughout the ship's interior adds contemporary elegance to the vessel's maritime ambience.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Outside the ship</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Refurbishment in 2018</h2>\n<p><strong>More comfort, new technology and better views of the spectacular Norwegian coast. MS Richard With emerged as a brand new ship in December 2018 during the largest upgrade project in Hurtigruten's history.</strong></p>\n<p>The upgrade saw a number of new features being added to the ship:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All staterooms and suites are fully upgraded to match Hurtigruten&rsquo;s new standards. On deck 6, a number of cabins were merged into <strong>14 larger suites</strong>, some with large bay windows and spectacular views.</li>\n<li>In addition to a full makeover, the aft-facing <strong>Torget main restaurant</strong> has large deck-to-ceiling windows.</li>\n<li>The brand-new <strong>Activity Center&nbsp;</strong>will act as the on-board headquarter for Hurtigruten&rsquo;s Expedition Team.</li>\n<li><strong>Kysten Fine Dining</strong> - serving innovative dishes based on high quality, local produce such as ultra-fresh seafood - is slightly different from other Hurtigruten ships, and also be open for a la carte lunch.</li>\n<li>The <strong>gym</strong> on deck 7 is bigger, the <strong>sauna</strong> upgraded and two aft-facing outdoor<strong> hot tubs</strong> are added.</li>\n<li>Two new <strong>lecture halls</strong> have been added on deck 4, together with the open <strong>Kompass information and shopping area</strong>, where guests can enjoy exclusive offers on outdoor clothing and other items.</li>\n<li>On deck 7, the informal and hugely popular Hurtigruten venue <strong>Multe Bakery</strong>&nbsp;is now open- serving freshly baked cakes and pastries,&nbsp;<em style=\"font-size: 1.1875rem;\">sm&oslash;rbr&oslash;d</em><span style=\"font-size: 1.1875rem;\">&nbsp;(open sandwiches with generous amounts of topping), smoothies, a large assortment of local ice cream with homemade toppings, premium coffee, organic herbal tea, and premium juice.</span></li>\n<li>The forward-facing <strong>Explorer Lounge and Panorama Bar</strong> offers a unique atmosphere and the best views on the ship &ndash; with front-row seats for enjoying the Northern Lights, Midnight Sun, wildlife and nature as it passes by.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Inside the ship</div>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Expedition team on board</h2>\n<p>MS Richard With has its own Expedition Team, and serves as a university at sea. Interesting lectures, presentations and activities inside as well as out on the sun deck of the ship make this an exciting and educational journey. Topics depend on the season and the waters we sail in. The Expedition Team hosts both a lecture and presentation programme and evening gatherings daily. Out on deck you may participate in live points of interest to learn more about the nature, culture and other phenomena we encounter along the coast. In addition, the Expedition Team will introduce you to the uniquely Norwegian notion of `friluftsliv&acute;, and encourage you take part in `friluftsliv&acute; hikes and activities during the journey.</p>\n<p>The dedicated Expedition Team has one mission: to enhance your experience by engaging you and interpreting the nature, wildlife, and culture you encounter during the voyage.

    "body": "<p>The ship is named after the <a href=\"/link/1b43b1c62c854e2cbcf3c584d868910b.aspx\">Lofoten archipelago</a>, which lies just north of the Arctic Circle. Famous for their dramatic scenery, the islands are often described as `nature&acute;s masterpiece&rsquo;. With its unique lounges and panoramic decks, MS Lofoten is inimitable in its own right. Get ready for a classic Hurtigruten experience onboard this beauty!&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>End of an Era with MS Lofoten</h2>\n<p>The upcoming 2020 season is your last chance to experience MS Lofoten&rsquo;s evocative 1960s atmosphere on our&nbsp;<a href=\"/link/434bac3444774558b65685a7e7fdec53.aspx\">famous 12-day, 34-port voyage along the Norwegian coast</a>.</p>\n<p>In December 2020, after 55 years faithfully sailing the Norwegian coast every day and every season, MS Lofoten will stop her daily service between Bergen and Kirkenes. Affectionately known as &lsquo;The Old Lady of the Sea&rsquo;, she is the most classic ship in our family and a glorious testament to the golden age of ocean liners. We invite you to come and be a part of her historic, final scheduled sailings, before she sets off on the next stage of her seafaring life.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Class of her own</div>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>In a class of her own</h3>\n<p>The highlight of MS Lofoten is her authenticity. Much of the ship&rsquo;s original d&eacute;cor has been lovingly restored and maintained, such as wood-panelled interiors, various brass fittings, original art, and porthole windows. She boasts comfortable lounges, generous panorama decks, and simple, cosy cabins. All add to her charm as a firm favourite for past guests. Her long-standing years of service mean she is also officially protected as a key part of Norway&rsquo;s maritime heritage, and rightly so.</p>\n<h3>Like-minded passengers</h3>\n<p>The smallest ship in our fleet carrying an average of 100 passengers, MS Lofoten attracts discerning travellers who prefer an intimate atmosphere and an authentic experience. The ship&rsquo;s size and nostalgia for vintage sailings of the 1960s make it easy to meet and make friends with fellow passengers who will likely share your appreciation for her timeless beauty.</p>\n<h3>Delicious suppers</h3>\n<p>Guests on MS Lofoten always rave about the <a href=\"/link/70f52ebc6eca48ffa9b41a42598d1fd7.aspx\">Coastal Kitchen</a> concept on board, especially the delicious four-course dinners inspired by the menus from the 1960s. Expect lavish buffets of prawns, crab, mussels, salmon, cod, and Arctic char, each delivered fresh from local suppliers at ports we visit during the voyage. In the style of a grand hotel, customary sherries or aperitifs are enjoyed before dinner, and for an extra touch, our crew don traditional uniforms to serve the food from silver platters.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Food, passengers gallery</div>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Useful links:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/link/fe97acb7970a4e72a459f13ea5f8e03b.aspx\"><strong>Practical and onboard information for cruises along the Norwegian Coast</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Special features:&nbsp;</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Special programme that enhances the classic Hurtigruten experience and spirit of the 1960s</li>\n<li>Special four-course dinners</li>\n<li>Additional activities especially designed for voyages on MS Lofoten</li>\n<li>Two sun decks</li>\n<li>Panorama lounge</li>\n<li>Caf&eacute;-bar including a lounge in the aft&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Shop</li>\n<li>Extra lounge at the front</li>\n<li>Restaurant</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Contact&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Tel: +47 91 35 20 00<br />Email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:resepsjon.lo@hurtigruten.com\">resepsjon.lo@hurtigruten.com</a></p>",

Despite modernisation, she still retains the aura of an old Atlantic ship, restored to her former splendour with new brass, classic wooden interiors and all her original art. Out on deck you come extra close to the untouched nature of the Polar Arctic and with roofs over a lot of the deck space you can enjoy being outside, even in rough weather.</p>\n<p>MS Nordstjernen is equipped with a dining room and bar, a caf&eacute;, a panorama lounge and a library. Inside you&rsquo;ll find cosy interior and exterior cabins, the majority of which have upper and lower berths. All rooms and deck surfaces exhibit that old, beautiful wood.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/link/e4cdfb3d68ce4d26985d6aa072656d4d.aspx\">Practical information for voyages with MS Nordstjernen</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Contact</h3>\n<p>Tel: +47 46 93 55 68 (only available in ports)<br />Email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:reception@msnordstjernen.com\">reception@msnordstjernen.com</a>&nbsp;</p>",

    "body": "<p>MS Spitsbergen is named after&nbsp;the crown jewel of Arctic Norway &ndash; the Svalbard archipelago and its biggest island, Spitsbergen. Hurtigruten&nbsp;has a long history of travelling&nbsp;to Spitsbergen, beginning in&nbsp;1896 with the `Sports Route&acute;. MS Spitsbergen cruises along the <a href=\"/link/1c89119a84a64fef91b93f9f042f7600.aspx\">Norwegian coast</a> from September to May, and becomes part of our global Explorer sailings during the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>After complete reconstruction, MS Spitsbergen joined the Hurtigruten fleet in 2016. The ship features high technical standards as well as comfortable, modern public areas and cabins. The vessel&acute;s fresh Scandinavian&nbsp;design reflects a colour palette&nbsp;derived from the sea. She is modern and&nbsp;environmentally progressive, and we plan further improvements that will reduce emissions and fuel consumption even more.&nbsp;The new ship&rsquo;s maneuverability&nbsp;and optimal size make her&nbsp;quite suitable for exploring polar waters.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">The ship and food</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Expedition team on board</h2>\n<p>MS Spitsbergen has its own on-board Expedition Team and serves as a university at sea. Interesting lectures inside the ship as well as out on the sun deck make this an exciting and educational journey. Topics depend on the season and the waters we sail in. The Expedition Team host a lecture programme and evening gatherings daily. Out on deck you can participate in live points of interest to learn more about the nature, culture and other phenomena we encounter along the coast. In addition, the Expedition Team will introduce you to the uniquely Norwegian notion of `friluftsliv&acute; (outdoor life), and encourage you take part in `friluftsliv&acute; hikes and activities during the journey.</p>\n<p>Our dedicated Expedition Teams have one mission: to enhance your experience by engaging you and interpreting the nature, wildlife, and culture you encounter during the voyage.

    "body": "<p>MS Maud, previously MS Midnatsol, is named after one of the most famous polar vessels of all time, Roald Amundsens &ldquo;Maud&rdquo; from 1917. The original &ldquo;Maud&rdquo; got her name from the first Queen of modern-day Norway. She also had her namesake in Hurtigruten&rsquo;s 1925 flagship DS Dronning Maud (&ldquo;DS Queen Maud&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Today&acute;s MS Maud is equipped with advanced technology that makes her exceptionally well-suited for <a href=\"/link/1c89119a84a64fef91b93f9f042f7600.aspx\">expedition cruises in Norway</a> and the <a href=\"/link/03e290b425a840228d1c6605a4975c39.aspx\">British Isles</a>.</p>\n<h2>Premium comfort, Science Center and gym</h2>\n<p>Her bright interiors are appointed in a classic Art Deco style. Colours are inspired by the Midnight Sun, allowing you to relax in warm vibes every day of the year. Channel your inner scientist in the advanced Science Center and enjoy daily lectures in the lecture hall or in the comfort of your cabin with our new streaming service, sample delicious Dishes from local suppliers in the restaurants and enjoy beverages in the Explorer lounge &amp; bar. On deck 9, you can enjoy the spectacular views from the outdoor Observation deck, and soak in one of the hot tubs. And there&acute;s no better way to enjoy the view than with a drink in the Explorer lounge &amp; bar.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also a gym and a sauna with beautiful views.</p>\n<h2>More sustainable voyages - powered with biofuel</h2>\n<p>Sustainability is the core of every detail of your Hurtigruten adventure. Hurtigruten is constantly pushing boundaries, and aim to become completely emission free.</p>\n<p>The ship will be powered with Biofuel, mixed in with Marine gasoil, to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides. Furthermore, the Biofuel used will be environmentally certified and made from waste produce from other industries such as fishing, meaning no palm oil used in its production and no negative effects on rainforests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the rest of the Hurtigruten fleet, single-use plastic is banned on MS Maud. This ship is also equipped for shore power, completely eliminating emissions when docked in ports with shore power facilities.</p>\n<h2>Facilities on board MS Maud</h2>\n<h3>Cabins and public areas</h3>\n<p>MS Maud is well-suited for expedition cruising, with a d&eacute;cor inspired by Norway&rsquo;s stunning nature, reflected in many of the pieces of Norwegian modern art on board.

    "body": "<p>MS Otto Sverdrup (formerly MS Finnmarken) is named after a great Norwegian polar hero. Sverdrup was the first person to ski across Greenland, was a key member of polar expeditions and was the captain of the legendary Arctic ship &ldquo;Fram&rdquo;. He also served as a Hurtigruten captain between expeditions.</p>\n<p>MS Otto Sverdrup is an advanced, more sustainable vessel. The ship also has the ability to access shore power when docked, cutting shoreside emissions.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Exterior</div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 1.375rem;\"><br />Comfort, Learning and Wellness</span></h2>\n<p>Natural Scandinavian materials like granite, oak, birch and wool have been used in the ship&acute;s renovation to create a relaxed and stylish atmosphere that adds to the premium onboard experience.</p>\n<p>This ship also offers a chance to indulge yourself in our new Wellness area, complete with gym, treatment rooms and sauna, and guests can enjoy the outdoor pool and hot tubs on deck 7. For taking in the magnificent scenery, outdoor observation decks are located on deck 8, and in the aft of decks 5 and 6.</p>\n<h2>More sustainable voyages - powered with biofuel</h2>\n<p>Sustainability is the core of every detail of your Hurtigruten adventure. Hurtigruten is constantly pushing boundaries, and aim to become completely emission free. As the first cruise line in the world, Hurtigruten is permanently introducing biodiesel as fuel on a number of ships &ndash; including MS Otto Sverdrup.</p>\n<p>Biodiesel reduces (CO2) emissions with up to 80 % (compared to regular marine diesel). Hurtigruten&rsquo;s environmentally certified biodiesel is produced from waste from industries such as fisheries and agriculture &ndash; which means no palm oil is used in the biofuel production and no negative effects on rainforests. Hurtigruten will use biodiesel in combination with other low-emission fuel.</p>\n<p>As the rest of the Hurtigruten fleet, single-use plastic is banned on MS Otto Sverdrup. This ship is also equipped for shore power, completely eliminating emissions when docked in ports with shore power facilities.</p>\n<h2>Facilities on board MS Otto Sverdrup</h2>\n<h3>Cabins and public areas</h3>\n<p>Norway&acute;s stunning scenery is reflected in the ship&acute;s interior design. Comfortable cabins and suites feature natural Scandinavian materials, such as granite, oak, birch and wool. Our stylish and welcoming public areas create great places to watch the world&acute;s most beautiful coastline pass by.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Cabins/public areas</div>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Science Center</h3>\n<p>The hub of on-board learning is our<strong> Science Centre</strong>, an edutainment venue where guests and crew meet to create a deeper understanding of the areas we explore. Located on deck 4, this area is packed with state-of-the-art technology and interactive tools.</p>\n<div class=\"epi-contentfragment\">Science center</div>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Restaurants</h3>\n<p>Welcome onboard to a culinary journey and our award-winning food sourcing program - Norways coastal Kitchen. You will find ingredients from our local suppliers along the coast in all three restaurants.
