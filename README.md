## Felix - Frontent Assignment

I had some problems with completing this task, as i've never used React nor TypeScript before...

I tried learning as i went, and got as far as to have the search-bar with styling and a working clear-icon,
however, i got stuck on the API-part with a CORS issue.

I tried to spend around five hours, but time was short due to a lot of interviews..

Hope this is understandable! :--)
