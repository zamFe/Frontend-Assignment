## Hurtigruten frontend assignment

This project allows Hurtigruten to asses potential frontend candidates with real, working code.

You will find the exercises in the [exercises.md](./exercises.md) file.

We don't expect you to use more than **5 hours** on this. If you're not finished after the time limit that's fine, just submit what you've got.

We have bootstrapped this assignment with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to give you the initial setup.

**If you feel strongly about using other frameworks (such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)), libraries or tools you are free to do so!**
